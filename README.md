# eNRRCrew: Accelerating eNRR catalyst Design through Multi-Agent Collaboration and Automated Structure-Activity Analysis

![Graphical Abstract](https://github.com/nkuhuxu/eNRRCrew/blob/main/images/TOC.png)

The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) represents a promising approach for sustainable ammonia production. However, understanding structure-activity relationships remains challenging due to the vast literature and complex data analysis required. Here, we present eNRRCrew, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs), machine learning techniques, and automated data analysis tools to advance eNRR research. The eNRRCrew comprises five agents, an orchestrator, a yield predictor, a Faradaic efficiency predictor, a GraphRAG retriever, and a CSV file handler. Users interact with eNRRCrew through the user interface provided by the Streamlit library to perform retrieval and prediction of structure-activity relationships in eNRR. 

 - **eNRR Yield predictor and FE predictor:** - Using pre-trained machine learning models in the former section to predict eNRR yield and FE.
 - **GraphRAG retriever:** - Enhancing responses by retrieving information from curated databases containing eNRR abstracts.
 - **CSV file handler:** - Writes and executes code to interact with CSV files obtained from text-mining workflow in response to user queries.
