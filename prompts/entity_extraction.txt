-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [chemical element, electrocatalyst, synthesis method, morphology, reaction condition, applied potential, pH level, electrolyte type, NH3 yield, faradaic efficiency]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is "English." as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is "English.", just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

 atom and Zr atom. Among the studied materials, W/Zr2CO2 possesses the highest NRR performance via the distal pathway with the NRR overpotential (qNRR) of 0.14 V, B/Zr2CO2 possesses the highest NRR performance (qNRR = 0.26 V) and selectivity via the enzymatic pathway, and for the co-doped systems, RuN3/Zr2CO2 delivers the highest NRR activity with the corresponding qNRR of 0.54 V. The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP), density of states, charge transfers, and work function (phi) results indicated that the TM and nonmetal atoms can adjust the electronic properties of the Zr2CO2 surface to break the inertness of N2 and form the key intermediate *NNH or *N*NH, and therefore enhance their NRR activity.

text:
Herein, we design and synthesize two metal-porphyrin based 3D COFs bearing metal-N4 catalytic sites with different 3D spatial arrangements (scu and flu topologies) for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaciton. The anchoring of metal ions (Fe, Cu) at the center of the planar conjugated-porphyrin ring enhances the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic NRR. Significantly, the 3D COFs with Fe-N4 catalytic sites feature higher NH3 yield and Faradaic efficiency (94.26 +/- 4.9 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) and 18.37 +/- 0.96 % at-0.5 V vs RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 than those with Cu-N-4 centers, making them promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts. 15N isotopic labeling experiment confirms that nitrogen in produced ammonia originates from N2 in the electrolyte. This work not only enriches the topological library of 3D COFs, but also provides an idea for the rational design of metal porphyrin-based COFs for NH3 production.
