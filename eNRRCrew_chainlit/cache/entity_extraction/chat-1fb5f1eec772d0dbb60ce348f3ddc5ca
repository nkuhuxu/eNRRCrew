Featuring the inherent half-filled 3d orbitals, ion-based alloy electrocatalysts have been attracting much more attention owing to the controllable driving force to adsorb and activate N equivalent to N bonds. Besides supplying unoccupied d-orbital to accommodate lone-pair electrons to facilitate nitrogen adsorption, donating d-orbital electrons to nitrogen antibonding orbitals to dissociate N equivalent to N bond is demandedas well. By palladium (Pd) to synthesize PdFe3 nano-alloy, numerous Fe 3d orbitals can be reconstructed via charge polarization between Fe and Pd, simultaneously lowering corresponding work functions. Meanwhile, the positively charged Fesites in PdFe3 can strengthen suppress the proton adsorption by electrostatic repulsion. A considerably optimized ammonia production rate of 29.07 mu g h(-1) mg(cat).(-1) and Faradic efficiency of 22.8% are accomplished at a low overpotential of -0.2 V vs. RHE. Density functional theory combined with in-situ ATR-FTIR results confirmthe electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction follows the associative distalmechanism and the electron-deficient Fe induced through Pd facilitates significantly lowering the first-step-protonation energy barrier of only 0.07 eV (*N-2+ *H ->*NNH).\nThis work reports that a low-temperature thermal calcination strategy was adopted to modulate the electronic structure and attain an abundance of surface-active sites while maintaining the crystal morphology. All the experiments demonstrate that the new photocatalyst nano MIL-125(Ti)-250 obtained by thermal calcination strategy has abundant Ti3+ induced by oxygen vacancies and high specific surface area. This facilitates the adsorption and activation of N-2 molecules on the active sites in the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The photocatalytic NH3 yield over MIL-125(Ti)-250 is enhanced to 156.9 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), over twice higher than that of the parent MIL-125(Ti) (76.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). Combined with density function theory (DFT), it shows that the N-2 adsorption pattern on the active sites tends to be from end-on to side-on mode, which is thermodynamically favourable. Moreover, the electrochemical tests demonstrate that the high atomic ratio of Ti3+/Ti4+ can enhance carrier separation, which also promotes the efficiency of photocatalytic N-2 fixation. This work may offer new insights into the design of innovative photocatalysts for various chemical reduction reactions.\nElectrocatalytic C-N coupling process is indeed a sustainable alternative for direct urea synthesis and co-upgrading of carbon dioxide and nitrate wastes. However, the main challenge lies in the unactivated C-N coupling process. Here, we proposed a strategy of intermediate assembly with alkali metal cations to activate C-N coupling at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Urea synthesis activity follows the trend of Li+\nRenewable production of ammonia via the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is highly desirable. However, rational design of electrocatalysts with high promising activity under ambient conditions is a challenging subject. In this work, the stability, NRR activity and selectivity of single transition metal (TM, TM = Ti, V, Fe, Ni, Nb, Mo, Ru, and W), nonmetal B and N, and TM and N3 co-modification Zr2CO2 (named TM/Zr2CO2, B (N)/Zr2CO2, and TMN3/Zr2CO2, respectively) are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results revealed that single atom (both transition metal and nonmetal atoms) modification can greatly enhance the NRR catalytic activity and selectivity of original Zr2CO2, and different nonmetal doping concentration can deliver different NRR activity by adjust the interaction strength between doping atom and Zr atom. Among the studied materials, W/Zr2CO2 possesses the highest NRR performance via the distal pathway with the NRR overpotential (qNRR) of 0.14 V, B/Zr2CO2 possesses the highest NRR performance (qNRR = 0.26 V) and selectivity via the enzymatic pathway, and for the co-doped systems, RuN3/Zr2CO2 delivers the highest NRR activity with the corresponding qNRR of 0.54 V. The crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP), density of states, charge transfers, and work function (phi) results indicated that the TM and nonmetal atoms can adjust the electronic properties of the Zr2CO2 surface to break the inertness of N2 and form the key intermediate *NNH or *N*NH, and therefore enhance their NRR activity. The ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation results suggested that the structures of the modified Zr2CO2 are dynamically stable at reaction temperature. These results indicated that the proposed surface modifications by W and nonmetal B are the effective approaches for achieving promising NRR electrocatalysts for N2 fixation.\nThe sustainable synthesis of ammonia via the direct reduction of nitrogen is expected to be achieved by the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) method; continuous efforts have been devoted to the search for excellent NRR catalysts. Herein, inspired by a few recent works, we performed a comprehensive first-principles calculation on eight vanadium (V)-anchored sulfur (S)-doped graphene catalysts (V-SxCNc-x@Gr) to study their NRR catalytic performance. V-S2C@Gr exhibits superior activity with extremely high limiting potential (U-L) of -0\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
