At the same time, more oxygen vacancies (OVs) are generated around Cu+. Fe4+ and OVs are both electron-deficient species, which are helpful for activating N-2 by trapping metastable electrons in the anti-bonding orbitals of adsorbed nitrogen molecules. This work provides a viable strategy for developing a highly efficient NRR electrocatalyst.\nWith its efficient nitrogen fixation kinetics, electrochemical lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (LMNRR) holds promise for replacing Haber-Bosch process and realizing sustainable and green ammonia production. However, the general interface problem in lithium electrochemistry seriously impedes the further enhancement of LMNRR performance. Inspired by the development history of lithium battery electrolytes, here, we extend the ring-chain solvents coupling law to LMNRR system to rationally optimize the interface during the reaction process, achieving nearly a two-fold Faradaic efficiency up to 54.78 +/- 1.60 %. Systematic theoretical simulations and experimental analysis jointly decipher that the anion-rich Li+ solvation structure derived from ring tetrahydrofuran coupling with chain ether successfully suppresses the excessive passivation of electrolyte decomposition at the reaction interface, thus promoting the mass transfer of active species and enhancing the nitrogen fixation kinetics. This work offers a progressive insight into the electrolyte design of LMNRR system. This work extends an interesting empirical electrolyte design law (ring-chain coupling law) to the lithium-mediated ammonia electrochemical synthesis system, which succeeds in improving the nitrogen fixation performance. Systematic theoretical calculation and experimental evidence jointly decipher the potential correlation between such strategy and enhanced performance from the angle of thermodynamics and mass transfer dynamics.+image\nThe development of environmentally sustainable and highly efficient technologies for ammonia production is crucial for the future advancement of carbon-neutral energy systems. The nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) for generating NH3 is a promising alternative to the low-efficiency nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), owing to the low N=O bond energy and high solubility of nitrite. In this study, we designed a highly efficient dual-atom catalyst with Fe-Cu atomic pair sites (termed FeCu DAC), and the as-developed FeCu DAC was able to afford a remarkable NH3 yield of 24,526 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) at -0.6 V, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) for NH3 production of 99.88 %. The FeCu DAC also exhibited exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in a Zn-NO2 battery, achieving a record-breaking power density of 23.6 mW cm(-2) and maximum NH3 FE of 92.23 % at 20 mA cm(-2). Theoretical simulation demonstrated that the incorporation of the Cu atom changed the energy of the Fe 3d orbital and lowered the energy barrier, thereby accelerating the NO2RR. This study not only demonstrates the potential of galvanic nitrite-based cells for expanding the field of Zn-based batteries, but also provides fundamental interpretation for the synergistic effect in highly dispersed dual-atom catalysts.\nElectrochemical reduction provides a promising and sustainable technology for ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions. At the moment, the majority of research is focused on developing catalysts with high yield and high faradaic efficiency. However, the characteristics of mass transportation and electrokinetics of the reactor are seldom discussed. In this study, a mathematical model was developed that combined mass transportation, charge migration, and electrode kinetics. The model was validated by using experimental data with an average error of 4.7%. With the established theoretical model, the significant physical and chemical phenomena inside the reactor were discussed in detail. Effects of structural and operating parameters including applied potential, N-2 concentration of feed gas, electrolyte concentration, width of the electrolyte channel, thickness of the catalyst layer, and electrolyte flow rate were investigated. The sensitivities of different parameters were further evaluated. It is believed that the work could provide meaningful guidance for the reactor design and scale-up strategy of electrochemical reduction of the N-2-to-NH3 process.\nThe electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) driven by renewable electricity is an up-and-coming method for sustainable ammonia production. However, since it is a multi-intermediate reaction, the inherent scaling relations between the adsorption energies of intermediates place restrictions on the overall performance. Herein, asymmetrical heterobimetallic sites are proposed to break the restriction of scaling relations on catalytic activity and boost ambient ammonia synthesis. According to density functional theory calculations, the heteronuclear FeCo dimer sites featuring a polarized surface with multielectron sites enable weakening of the N0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111111111111111000000000000000000011111111111111100000000000000000001111111111111110000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000N bond and maximized activation of N2. The optimization of the binding strength of certain intermediates thus becomes feasible, contributing to a significantly reduced energy barrier of the NRR. Experimentally, the asymmetrical heterobimetallic catalyst delivers a superior ammonia yield rate of 70.11 mu g h-1 mg-1 with a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 32.16%. This study suggests that the presence of asymmetrical heterobimetallic sites defines a special opportunity for breaking scaling relations to achieve efficient multi-intermediate electrocatalytic reactions. Asymmetrical heterobimetallic FeCo dimer sites featuring a polarized surface with multielectron sites enable weakening of the NN bond and maximized activation of N2, contributing to significantly facilitated ambient ammonia synthesis.\nManipulating the coordination environment of individual active sites in\n######################\noutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Cu<|>chemical element<|>Cu is an electron-deficient species that helps activate N2 by trapping metastable electrons in the anti-bonding orbitals of adsorbed nitrogen molecules.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Fe<|>chemical element<|>Fe is an electron-deficient species that aids in activating N2 by trapping metastable electrons in the anti-bonding orbitals of adsorbed nitrogen molecules.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVs<|>morphology<|>OVs, or oxygen vacancies, are generated around Cu+ and are helpful for activating N2 in the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LMNRR<|>synthesis method<|>Lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (LMNRR) is a method that holds promise for sustainable and green ammonia production, potentially replacing the Haber-Bosch process.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>54.78 +/- 1.60 %<|>faradaic efficiency<|>54.78 +/- 1.60 % is the Faradaic efficiency achieved in the lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (LMNRR).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>24,526 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1)<|>NH3 yield<|>24,526 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) is the NH3 yield achieved by the dual-atom catalyst (FeCu DAC) at -0.6 V.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>99.88 %<|>faradaic efficiency<|>99.88 % is the Faradaic efficiency for NH3 production achieved by the dual-atom catalyst (FeCu DAC).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FeCu DAC<|>electrocatalyst<|>FeCu DAC is a dual-atom catalyst that exhibits remarkable NH3 yield and Faradaic efficiency in the nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NO2RR<|>synthesis method<|>Nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) is a promising alternative to the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for generating NH3.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>-0.6 V<|>applied potential<-0.6 V is the applied potential at which the dual-atom catalyst (FeCu DAC) achieves a remarkable NH3 yield.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>32.16%<|>faradaic efficiency<|>32.16% is the Faradaic efficiency achieved by the asymmetrical heterobimetallic catalyst in the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>70.11 mu g h-1 mg-1<|>NH3 yield<|>70.11 mu g h-1 mg-1 is the ammonia yield rate delivered by the asymmetrical heterobimetallic catalyst.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Cu<|>OVs<|>Cu is associated with the generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs) that help activate N2 in the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Fe<|>OVs<|>Fe is associated with the generation of oxygen vacancies (OVs) that help activate N2 in the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FeCu DAC<|>NO2RR<|>FeCu DAC is a dual-atom catalyst that demonstrates exceptional performance in the nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) for NH3 production.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FeCu DAC<|>24,526 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1)<|>The NH3 yield of 24,526 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) is achieved by the FeCu DAC in the NO2RR.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FeCu DAC<|>99.88 %<|>The Faradaic efficiency of 99.88 % for NH3 production is achieved by the FeCu DAC in the NO2RR.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LMNRR<|>54.78 +/- 1.60 %<|>The Faradaic efficiency of 54.78 +/- 1.60 % is achieved in the lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (LMNRR).<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Fe<|>FeCu DAC<|>Fe is part of the dual-atom catalyst (FeCu DAC) that enhances the performance in the nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR).<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Cu<|>FeCu DAC<|>Cu is part of the dual-atom catalyst (FeCu DAC) that enhances the performance in the nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR).<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>32.16%<|>70.11 mu g h-1 mg-1<|>The Faradaic efficiency of 32.16% is associated with the ammonia yield rate of 70.11 mu g h-1 mg-1 achieved by the asymmetrical heterobimetallic catalyst.<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
