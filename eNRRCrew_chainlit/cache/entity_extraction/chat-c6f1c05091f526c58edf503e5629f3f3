The results revealed that the TM@BC3N2 systems exhibited remarkable catalytic activity in the nitrogen-reduction reaction (NRR). The fine NRR activity was related to the just-right bonding/antibonding orbital interactions between the 2 pi* of N-2 and the d orbitals of the TM ions. The nitrogen-adsorption configurations were found to have different activation mechanisms. In addition, the effects of convectively formed convex nitrogen defects (V-N) on the interaction between N-2 and V-N-TM@BC3N2 and the NRR process of V-N-TM@BC3N2 were studied, and it was found that V-N could fine-tune the reaction efficiency of the eNRR because after N atom dissociation to form V-N, the interaction of TM-C-3 was enhanced, and the activation of nitrogen and adsorption of NH3 by the TM-active centers were weakened. The present study can be used as a motivation for further experimental and theoretical research of 2D monolayers as NRR electrocatalysts.\nPhotocatalytic and electrocatalytic reactions to produce value-added chemicals offer promising solutions for addressing the energy crisis and environmental pollution. Photocatalysis is driven by light excitation and charge separation and relies on semiconducting catalysts, while electrocatalysis is driven by external electric current and is mostly based on metallic catalysts with high electrical conductivity. Due to the distinct reaction mechanism, the conversion between the two catalytic types has remained largely unexplored. Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we demonstrated that the ferroelectric heterostructures Mo-BN@In2Se3 and WSe2@In2Se3 can exhibit semiconducting or metallic features depending on the polarization direction as a result of the built-in field and electron transfer. Using the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as examples, the metallic heterostructures act as excellent electrocatalysts for these reactions, while the semiconducting heterostructures serve as the corresponding photocatalysts with improved optical absorption, enhanced charge separation, and low Gibbs free energy change. The findings not only bridge physical phenomena of the electronic phase transition with chemical reactions but also offer a new and feasible approach to significantly improve the catalytic efficiency.\nThe NH3 synthesis from N-2 plays an important role in the ecological cycle and industrial production. Different from industrial NH3 synthesis with high pollution and energy consumption, electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis is favored because of its environmental protection, energy saving, ambient reaction conditions and other characteristics. However, due to the low efficiency and poor reaction selectivity of the existing electrocatalysts, which can not be used actually, the development of new electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is particularly urgent. Herein, we designed a series of transition metal atoms anchored B-doped defective C3N surface (TM@B2C3N) as single-atom catalysts. Through the screening process of N-2 adsorption activation, N2H formation and NH3 desorption, finally the excellent electrocatalysts with strong stability and high activity (Cr@B2C3N and Mn@B2C3N) were obtained. After simulating the entire pathway, it was found that the NRR process on Cr@B2C3N and Mn@B2C3N via consecutive and distal pathways with the lowest limiting potential of -0.42 and -0.52 V, which have the good ability to inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction. Finally, the electronic properties were analyzed, and the reason for their high catalytic activity was summarized. This work provides a new idea for the rational design of NRR electrocatalysts and promotes the practical application of electrocatalysts.\nBimetallic oxides generally exhibit excellent electrochemical properties because of their strong electrocatalytic activity and the synergistic effects between different metals. In this work, three-dimensional flower-like nickel-manganese bimetallic oxides @ carbon cloth (NiMnOx@CC) were synthesized by in situ growth on carbon cloth with a simple hydrothermal reaction. The effects of different metal salt ratios on the structure and electrochemical properties of bimetallic oxides were studied systematically. Morphologies and microstructures of all samples were verified by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Our results showed that when the molar ratio of nickel-manganese reaches 1:1, the bimetal oxidation morphology has a regular flower-like structure, formed by the staggered accumulation of nanosheets. The obtained typical catalyst NiMnOx-3@CC possesses high ammonia yield (16 mu g(-1) h(-1) mg(-1)) and Faraday efficiency (FE) (19%) at -0.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is attributed to the synergistic effects between nickel and manganese oxides. On the one hand, this unique cross-stacking structure of nanosheets can effectively avoid the aggregation of catalysts, which is conducive to providing more active sites; on the other hand, the abundance of oxygen vacancy is conducive to the adsorption and activation of nitrogen gas. This work demonstrates an efficient in situ assembly strategy for bimetallic oxide electrocatalysts, which can improve the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen to ammonia at ambient temperature and pressure.\nIn this study, niobium nitride (NbN) is prepared via the urea-glass route by annealing a mixture of NbCl5 and urea at 650 degrees C under a flow of N2, and is used as a catalyst for\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
