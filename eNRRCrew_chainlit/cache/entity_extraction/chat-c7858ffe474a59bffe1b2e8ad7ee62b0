Of these, four DACs (FeMoN5B1, FeMoN5O1, FeMoN4O2, and FeMoN3C3) displayed promising nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. Notably, FeMoN5O1 stands out with an ultralow limiting potential of -0.11 V and high selectivity. Analysis of the density of states and charge/spin changes shows FeMoN5O1 ' s high activity arises from optimal N2 binding on Fe initially and synergy of the FeMo dimer enabling protonation in NRR. This work contributes to the advancement of rational design for efficient NRR catalysts by regulating atomic coordination environments. A set of heteronuclear dual-atom catalysts (DACs) denoted as FeMoN6-aXa (a=1, 2, 3; X=B, C, O, S) immobilized within the pores of g-C3N4 was designed by density functional theory computations, aiming to explore the nitrogen fixation activity of the Fe-Mo center and the influence of the coordination environment.image\nThe electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) driven by renewable electricity provides a green synthesis route for ammonia (NH3) production under ambient conditions but suffers from a low conversion yield and poor Faradaic efficiency (F.E.) because of strong competition from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the poor solubility of N2 in aqueous systems. Herein, an in situ proton filter covalent organic framework catalyst (Ru-Tta-Dfp) is reported with inherent Ruthenium (Ru) sites where the framework controls reactant diffusion by suppressing proton supply and enhancing N2 flux, causing highly selective and efficient catalysis. The smart catalyst design results in a remarkable ammonia production yield rate of 2.03 mg h-1 mgcat-1 with an excellent F.E. of approximate to 52.9%. The findings are further endorsed with the help of molecular dynamics simulations and control COF systems without in situ proton filter feasibility. The results point to a paradigm shift in engineering high-performance NRR electrocatalysts for more feasible green NH3 production. A covalent organic framework (COF) (Ru-Tta-Dfp) with in-situ proton filter ability to reduce proton supply while increasing N2 flux for efficient nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is developed. A remarkable ammonia production yield rate of 2.03 mg h-1 mgcat-1 with an excellent F.E. of 52.9% is achieved. This work prospects the development of COF-based NRR catalysts to enable effective NH3 production.image\nElectrochemical ammonia synthesis, which couples oxygen evolution at the anode with nitrogen reduction at the cathode, holds great significance for future food and energy needs. Both of these half-cell reactions determine the overall cell potential and efficiency of the process. However, the employment of different catalysts on either side, due to discrete mechanisms, increases the complexity and material processing costs of the system, where the designing of a bifunctional catalyst active towards both the NRR and OER is of huge significance. Unfortunately, the initial screening of the designed catalysts via physical characterizations, optical methods and other techniques, does not provide details about the electrochemical activity. The scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) technique can be useful to screen multi-catalysts at the same time for their electrochemical activities. Herein, we employed the sample generation-tip collection (SG-TC) mode of SECM to screen the designed NixBy catalysts before half-cell investigations, which suggested that the catalyst synthesized via sonochemical reduction (SR), i.e. NixBy (SR), was a better catalyst. This inference was in accordance with the half-cell NRR and OER measurements (FE: 49% for NH3 production, OER overpotential: 300 mV). By virtue of this remarkable bifunctional activity, the NRR-OER coupled full cell was assembled, which initiated the NH3 production at just 1.7 V and produced NH3 (1.08 mg h(-1) mgcat(-1)) at the cathode and O-2 (0.81 mg h(-1) mgcat(-1)) at the anode after 2 h of electrolysis at 1.9 V.\nThe development of electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts with high catalytic activity and high stability is a significant challenge. In this work, a LaCu0.1Fe0.9O3-delta (LCuF) electrocatalyst for NRR was developed based on B-site Cu doping in the LaFeO3 (LF) perovskite. Good NRR catalytic performance and long-term stability were achieved when this catalyst was used as the cathode material for a protonic ceramic electrolysis cell (PCEC). Experimental results demonstrate that the synergistic effect between Cu and Fe enhances the NRR activity of this electrocatalyst. Electrons are transferred through the Fe-O2-delta-Cu chain, resulting in the formation of more Fe4+ at Fe sites and more Cu+ at Cu sites. This accelerates the electron transfer rate and thus increases the NRR rate. At the same time, more oxygen vacancies (OVs) are generated around Cu+. Fe4+ and OVs are both electron-deficient species, which are helpful for activating N-2 by trapping metastable electrons in the anti-bonding orbitals of adsorbed nitrogen molecules. This work provides a viable strategy for developing a highly efficient NRR electrocatalyst.\nWith its efficient nitrogen fixation kinetics, electrochemical lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
