This study suggests that the presence of asymmetrical heterobimetallic sites defines a special opportunity for breaking scaling relations to achieve efficient multi-intermediate electrocatalytic reactions. Asymmetrical heterobimetallic FeCo dimer sites featuring a polarized surface with multielectron sites enable weakening of the NN bond and maximized activation of N2, contributing to significantly facilitated ambient ammonia synthesis.\nManipulating the coordination environment of individual active sites in a precise manner remains an important challenge in electrocatalytic reactions. Herein, inspired by theoretical predictions, a facile procedure to synthesize a series of symmetry-breaking zinc metal-organic framework (Zn-MOF) catalysts with well-defined structures is presented. Benefiting from the optimized coordination microenvironment regulated by symmetry-breaking, Zn-N2S2-MOF exhibits the best performance of nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) with NH3 yield rate of 25.07 +/- 1.57 mu g h-1 cm-2 and Faradaic efficiency of 44.57 +/- 2.79% compared with reported Zn-based NRR catalysts. X-ray absorption near-edge structure shows that the symmetry-breaking distorts the coordination environment and modulates the delocalized electrons around the Zn sites, which favors the formation of unpaired low-valence Zn delta+, thereby facilitating the adsorption/activation of N2. Theoretical calculations elucidate that low-valence Zn delta+ in Zn-N2S2-MOF can effectively lower the energy barrier of potential determining step, promoting the kinetics and boosting the NRR activity. This work highlights the relationship between the precise coordination environment of metal sites and the catalytic activity, which offers insightful guidance for rationally designing high-efficiency electrocatalysts. A series of well-structured, symmetry-breaking zinc metal-organic framework catalysts are synthesized for nitrogen reduction, highlighting the correlation between the coordination environment of metal sites, low-valence Zn delta+ formation, and catalytic activity.image\nAs a cleaner and more energy-efficient alternative, the electrochemical reduction of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions has emerged as a promising avenue for environmental protection. However, developing catalysts with both high activity and selectivity has been a challenging task. The advent of atomically dispersed catalysts is revolutionizing the field of catalysis. Drawing inspiration from the successful fabrication of Ru trimer on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets, herein, we adopted a series of trimeric metal clusters anchored on g-C3N4 monolayer (TM3@g-C3N4, TM = 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal atom), as well as utilized the criteria range to describe the stability, activity, energy cost and selectivity of supported trimers for N2 reduction reaction based on ab initio calculations combined with multi-level screening strategies. Finally, 5 candidate TM3@g-C3N4 (TM = Rh, Ru, V, Mo, and Re) exhibits decent catalytic activity with limiting potential ranging of -0.50 - -0.02 V. These spatially confined triatomic metal centers demonstrated proficiency in activating N2 molecules while exhibiting tunable surficial reactivity through modulation of the metal elements and interfacial electron coupling between trimers and underlying substrates. More importantly, a structure-activity relationship was established, which provides crucial insights for precise design of highly efficient atomically-precise catalysts at an atomic level for hydrogen fuel storage.\nThe electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) has emerged as a promising approach for synthesizing ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen (N-2) under mild conditions. However, due to the difficulty in activating stable N-2 molecules and the competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the development of active NRR electrocatalysts achieving a high NH3 formation rate and a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) is strongly desired. Herein, Cu-doped hematite (Fe2O3) nanorod arrays are synthesized by hydrothermal treatment and annealing under a N-2 atmosphere. At -0.15 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), 4.4% Cu-doped Fe2O3 exhibits a NH3 formation rate of 12.5 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) and a FE of 16.4%, demonstrating a significant improvement in the NRR performance with Cu doping. The introduction of Cu increases the number of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface and induces charge redistribution between the constituent Cu and Fe ions, promoting the adsorption and activation of N-2. Thus, this study not only offers an attractive earth-abundant NRR electrocatalyst but also provides an insight that heteroatom doping is effective to enhance the NRR activity through both defect engineering and electronic modulation.\nThe electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) has attracted much attention for its use in the production of fertilizers and other chemicals. Herein, we demonstrate that the NRR can be enhanced when using Fe/Co co-doped MoS2 (FeCo-MoS2) nanosheets as the electrocatalyst. At the optimal doping concentration, the FeCo-MoS2 nanosheets provided a NH3 yield rate of 3.27 mg/h/cm2 at -0.55 V [vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)], a value superior to those of undoped MoS2, Fe-doped MoS2, and Co-doped MoS2 samples by 191, 176, and 116%, respectively. Moreover, the Faradaic efficiency of 6.28% at -0.35 V (vs RHE) exceeded those of the undoped MoS2, Fe-doped Mo\n######################\noutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Fe<|>chemical element<|>Fe is a chemical element that is part of the asymmetrical heterobimetallic FeCo dimer sites, contributing to the activation of N2 for ammonia synthesis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Co<|>chemical element<|>Co is a chemical element that is part of the asymmetrical heterobimetallic FeCo dimer sites, contributing to the activation of N2 for ammonia synthesis.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Zn<|>chemical element<|>Zn is a chemical element used in the synthesis of zinc metal-organic framework (Zn-MOF) catalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Zn-N2S2-MOF<|>electrocatalyst<|>Zn-N2S2-MOF is an electrocatalyst that exhibits the best performance for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) with a high NH3 yield rate.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Cu<|>chemical element<|>Cu is a chemical element used in the doping of hematite (Fe2O3) nanorod arrays to enhance nitrogen reduction reaction performance.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Fe2O3<|>electrocatalyst<|>Fe2O3 is an electrocatalyst that, when doped with Cu, shows improved performance in nitrogen reduction reactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MoS2<|>electrocatalyst<|>MoS2 is an electrocatalyst that can be co-doped with Fe and Co to enhance its performance in nitrogen reduction reactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NH3 yield rate of 25.07 +/- 1.57 mu g h-1 cm-2<|>NH3 yield<|>The NH3 yield rate of 25.07 +/- 1.57 mu g h-1 cm-2 is the performance metric for Zn-N2S2-MOF in nitrogen reduction reactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Faradaic efficiency of 44.57 +/- 2.79%<|>faradaic efficiency<|>The Faradaic efficiency of 44.57 +/- 2.79% is the performance metric for Zn-N2S2-MOF in nitrogen reduction reactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>-0.50 - -0.02 V<|>applied potential<|>-0.50 - -0.02 V is the range of limiting potential for the TM3@g-C3N4 electrocatalysts in nitrogen reduction reactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>-0.15 V vs RHE<|>applied potential<-0.15 V vs RHE is the applied potential for the Cu-doped Fe2O3 nanorod arrays in nitrogen reduction reactions.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>-0.55 V<|>applied potential<-0.55 V is the applied potential at which the FeCo-MoS2 nanosheets provide a NH3 yield rate of 3.27 mg/h/cm2.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Faradaic efficiency of 6.28%<|>faradaic efficiency<|>The Faradaic efficiency of 6.28% is the performance metric for the FeCo-MoS2 nanosheets in nitrogen reduction reactions.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Fe<|>FeCo-MoS2<|>Fe is one of the elements in the co-doped MoS2 that enhances the nitrogen reduction reaction performance.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Co<|>FeCo-MoS2<|>Co is one of the elements in the co-doped MoS2 that enhances the nitrogen reduction reaction performance.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Zn<|>Zn-N2S2-MOF<|>Zn is a key component in the synthesis of Zn-N2S2-MOF, which exhibits high performance in nitrogen reduction reactions.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Cu<|>Fe2O3<|>Cu doping in Fe2O3 enhances its performance in nitrogen reduction reactions.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Zn-N2S2-MOF<|>NH3 yield rate of 25.07 +/- 1.57 mu g h-1 cm-2<|>The NH3 yield rate of 25.07 +/- 1.57 mu g h-1 cm-2 is a performance metric for Zn-N2S2-MOF in nitrogen reduction reactions.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Zn-N2S2-MOF<|>Faradaic efficiency of 44.57 +/- 2.79%<|>The Faradaic efficiency of 44.57 +/- 2.79% is a performance metric for Zn-N2S2-MOF in nitrogen reduction reactions.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>-0.15 V vs RHE<|>Fe2O3<|>-0.15 V vs RHE is the applied potential for the Cu-doped Fe2O3 nanorod arrays in nitrogen reduction reactions.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>-0.55 V<|>FeCo-MoS2<|>-0.55 V is the applied potential at which the FeCo-MoS2 nanosheets provide a NH3 yield rate of 3.27 mg/h/cm2.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Faradaic efficiency of 6.28%<|>FeCo-MoS2<|>The Faradaic efficiency of 6.28% is a performance metric for the FeCo-MoS2 nanosheets in nitrogen reduction reactions.<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
