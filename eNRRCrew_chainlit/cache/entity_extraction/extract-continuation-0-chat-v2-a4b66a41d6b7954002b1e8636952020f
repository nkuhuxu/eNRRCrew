Density functional theory calculations revealed that the preferred reaction mediated by the FeCo-MoS2 electrocatalyst followed a distal pathway, with its potentialdetermining step having an energy barrier (0.54 eV) lower than that of undoped MoS2 (1.13 eV), suggesting that the FeCo-MoS2 nanosheets possessed superior electrocatalytic activity.

In this study, we reveal that the hybrid Cu+/Cu0 interface is catalytically active for electrochemical ammonia synthesis from nitrate reduction. To maintain the hybrid Cu+/Cu0 state at negative reaction potentials, hydrophilic zeolite is used to modify Cu/Cu2O electrocatalyst, which demonstrates an impressive NH3 production rate of 41.65 mg h-1 cm-2 with-100% Faradaic efficiency of ammonia synthesis at-0.6 V vs. RHE. In-situ Raman spectroscopy unveil the high activity originates from the zeolite reconstruction at the electrode-electrolyte interface, which protects the valence state of Cu0/ Cu+ site under negative potential and promotes electrochemical activity towards NH3 synthesis.(c) 2023 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) exhibits promises in electrocatalysis. However, the lack of reactive sites significantly limited the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 when applied in the reduction of N2 to produce ammonia. Herein, we successfully prepared a NiSx/MoS2 heterostructural composite with abundant interfaces exposed. Moreover, the presence of metallic phase 1T-MoS2 provided better conductivity and more active sites. Benefited from this interface design, as-prepared NiSx/MoS2 composites exhibited excellent electrocatalytic ac-tivity in reduction of N2. The ammonia yield rate reached as high as 68.78 mu g h-1 mg-cat.1 at-0.60 V (vs. RHE) with a Faradic efficiency of 48.53 % at-0.50 V (vs. RHE), as well as charming selectivity and long-term stability. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicated that the heterointerface formed between NiSx/ MoS2 composites facilitated electrons transfer. And the adsorption of N2 on the Mo site is more stable, which synergistically improves the NRR performance. This work provides new evidences of constructing heterojunction materials to accelerate electron transfer between interfaces for highly efficient electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction.\nAmbient electrocatalytic nitrogen (N-2) reduction has gained significant recognition as a potential substitute for producing ammonia (NH3). However, N-2 adsorption and *NN protonation for N-2 activation reaction with the competing hydrogen evolution reaction remain a daunting challenge. Herein, a defect-rich TiO2 nanosheet electrocatalyst with PdCu alloy nanoparticles (PdCu/TiO2-x) is designed to elucidate the reactivity and selectivity trends of N2 cleavage path for N-2-to-NH3 catalytic conversion. The introduction of oxygen vacancy (OV) not only acts as active sites but also effectively promotes the electron transfer from Pd-Cu sites to high-concentration Ti3+ sites, and thus lends to the N(2 )activation via electron donation of PdCu. OVs-mediated control effectively lowers the reaction barrier of *N2H and *H adsorption and facilitates the first hydrogenation process of N-2 activation. Consequently, PdCu/TiO2-x catalyst attains a high rate of NH3 evolution, reaching 5.0 mmol gcat.(-1) h(-1). This work paves a pathway of defect-engineering metal-supported electrocatalysts for high-efficient ammonia electrosynthesis.\nNitrogen fixation using electrochemical methods on the surface of single-atom catalysts (SACs) provides a highly feasible strategy for green and low-energy-consumption ammonia (NH3) production. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explored in detail the potential of monolayer BC3N2 SACs supported with 3d transition metal (TM) atoms (TM@BC3N2) to facilitate nitrogen reduction. The results revealed that the TM@BC3N2 systems exhibited remarkable catalytic activity in the nitrogen-reduction reaction (NRR). The fine NRR activity was related to the just-right bonding/antibonding orbital interactions between the 2 pi* of N-2 and the d orbitals of the TM ions. The nitrogen-adsorption configurations were found to have different activation mechanisms.
