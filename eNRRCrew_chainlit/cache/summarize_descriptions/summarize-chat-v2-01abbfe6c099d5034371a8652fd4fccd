{"result": "N2, or nitrogen gas, plays a crucial role in the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), which is fundamental for ammonia synthesis. In this process, N2 is the nitrogen molecule that undergoes reduction to yield ammonia. The effective utilization of N2 in the NRR is essential for developing efficient electrochemical methods for ammonia production, highlighting its significance in both industrial applications and research focused on optimizing electrocatalytic processes.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in electrochemistry and catalysis.
