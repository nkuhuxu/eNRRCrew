{"result": "Co-carbon nanofibers (CNF) serve as a crucial component in the development of advanced electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction reactions (NO3RR). They are utilized in conjunction with ZIF-CoP to significantly enhance the performance of these reactions, facilitating the conversion of nitrate to ammonia. The unique morphology of CNF, characterized by a 3D core-shell structure, is specifically designed to optimize the electrocatalytic process, thereby improving the efficiency and yield of ammonia production.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in electrochemistry and catalysis.
