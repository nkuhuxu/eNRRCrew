Increasing the membrane thickness altered the rate of NH4+ losses, however, the NH4+ crossover and volatilization cannot be fully mitigated. Lastly, the cation exchange between membrane-adsorbed NH4+ and Na+ from the electrolyte is proposed as a membrane-cleaning procedure to reduce false positives in electrochemical NH3/NH4+ production studies.\nTwo renewable methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with ammonia (NH3) production are the renewable H-2-combined Haber-Bosch process and the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR). However, progress in eNRR has fallen short of expectations. Here, we demonstrated a well-controlled electrochemically viable and clean NH3 production with spinel-type (V,Ni,Mn)(3)O4-x/Nb2O5-y nanoflowers, successfully synthesized via a facile one-pot hydrothermal method on nickel foam, aimed at boosting the eNRR performance, after surveying many Ni-V-Mn-Nb quaternary, ternary, and binary oxide systems for their electrochemical and structural properties. The best NH3 yield from a quaternary system exhibited the most promising results, achieving 3.19 mg h(-1) cm(-2) (1.28 mg h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1)) at a potential of -0.5 V vs. RHE, with a remarkable faradaic efficiency (FE) of 22.7%, which is superb among the current state of the art methods. Besides, the electrocatalyst performance, evaluated in terms of energy conversion, showed a cell energy efficiency of 37.66%. An NN bond-weakening micro-mechanism of electron transport for the nonstoichiometric Ni-V-Mn-Nb oxide system is proposed to elucidate this exceptional activity. Furthermore, we suggest a reaction micro-mechanism encompassing electron transport and N-2 trapping, contributing to the observed excellent activity in NH3 production.\nThe energy-intensive processes for the industrial production of ammonia necessitates the development of new methods to be proposed that will aid in reducing the global energy consumption. Specifically, the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to produce ammonia is more thermodynamically feasible than the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). However, it is hindered by a low catalytic activity due to its complex reaction pathways. Herein, we synthesized a novel electrocatalyst, RuOx-Co3O4 nanoparticles, with abundant interfaces, which exhibited an enhanced catalytic activity for efficient ammonia synthesis. This catalyst delivered a partial current density of 65.8 mA cm(-2) for NH3 production, a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 89.7%, and a superior ammonia yield rate of up to 210.5 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2) at -0.6 V vs. RHE. X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the formed interfacial Ru-O-Co bond can decorate the electronic structures of the active sites and accelerate the absorption of NO3-, thus promoting the production of ammonia.\nAmmonia is of great importance in fertilizer production and chemical synthesis. It can also potentially serve as a carbon-free energy carrier for a future hydrogen economy. Motivated by a worldwide effort to lower carbon emissions, ammonia synthesis by lithium-mediated electrochemical nitrogen reduction (LiNR) has been considered as a promising alternative to the Haber-Bosch process. A significant performance improvement in LiNR has been achieved in recent years by exploration of favorable lithium salt and proton donor for the electrolyte recipe, but the solvent study is still in its infancy. In this work, a systematic investigation on ether-based solvents toward LiNR is conducted. The assessments of solvent candidates are built on their conductivity, parasitic reactions, product distribution, and faradaic efficiency. Notably, dimethoxyethane gives the lowest potential loss among the investigated systems, while tetrahydrofuran achieves an outstanding faradaic efficiency of 58.5 +/- 6.1% at an ambient pressure. We found that solvent molecules impact the above characteristics by dictating the solvation configurations of conductive ions and inducing the formation of solid electrolyte interphase with different compositions. This study highlights the importance of solvents in the LiNR process and advances the electrolyte optimization for better performance.\n######################\noutput:"}, {"role": "assistant",
