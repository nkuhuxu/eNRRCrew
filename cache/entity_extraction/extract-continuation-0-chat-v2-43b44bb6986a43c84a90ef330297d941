Nevertheless, it remains a major challenge to explore economical and efficient electrocatalysts that deliver high NH3 yield rates and Faraday efficiencies (FE). Here, it demonstrates the fabrication of a 3D core-shell structured Co-carbon nanofibers (CNF)/ZIF-CoP for NO3RR application. Benefitting from the distinct electron transport property of Co-CNF and desirable mass transfer ability from amorphous CoP framework, the as-prepared Co-CNF/ZIF-CoP exhibits large NH3 FE (96.8 +/- 3.4% at -0.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and high yield rate (38.44 +/- 0.65 mg cm-2 h-1 at -0.6 V vs RHE), which are better than Co-CNF/ZIF-crystal CoP. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that amorphous CoP presents a lower energy barrier in the rate determination step of the protonation of *NO to produce *NOH intermediates compared with crystal CoP, resulting in a superior NO3RR performance. Eventually, an aqueous galvanic Zn-NO3- battery is assembled by using Co-CNF/ZIF-CoP as cathode material to achieve efficient production of NH3 whilst simultaneously supplying electrical power. This work offers a reliable strategy to construct amorphous metal phosphide framework on conducting CNF as efficient electrocatalyst and enriches its promising application for NO3RR. A facile strategy has been demonstrated to prepare 3D core-shell structured Co-carbon nanofibers (CNF)/ZIF-CoP with amorphous CoP framework derived from ZIF-67 as the shell, which can be used as an efficient NO3RR electrocatalyst, presenting a large NH3 FE (96.8 +/- 3.4% at -0.1 V vs RHE) and high yield rate (38.44 +/- 0.65 mg h-1 cm-2 at -0.6 V vs RHE). The electrocatalytic mechanism reveals that both efficient electron transfer property from Co-CNF and desirable mass transfer ability from amorphous CoP framework contribute to the superior NO3RR performance.image\nElectrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a green and sustainable method for NH3 production, but it suffers from poor activity and low selectivity due to the high energy barrier of nitrogen activation. Herein, we propose the construction of ultrafine gold-copper nanowires (AuCu NWs) via a rapid wet-chemical reduction process for electrochemical ammonia synthesis. The one-dimensional structure provides a large surface area, good electrical conductivity and facilitated mass/charge transfer. Moreover, bimetallic composition can optimize the adsorption energy of intermediates on catalysts. As such, the AuCu NWs display higher NRR performance at a low potential of -0.2 V under neutral conditions, with an ammonia yield of 31.57 mu g h-1 mg-1cat. and a faradaic efficiency of 22.1%. This work provides a feasible strategy for the construction of ultrafine nanowire structures towards the electro-reduction of nitrogen to ammonia. We report a simple strategy to synthesize one-dimensional ultrafine AuCu nanowires for highly efficient electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen to ammonia.\nElectrocatalytic nitrate (NO3-) reduction represents one of the most promising approaches to mitigate NO3- pollution and yield NH3, but it is still challenged by the atomic economy and selectivity issues of substantial active sites. Here, we describe a comprehensive investigation on a series of single-atom catalysts (SACs) using nitrogen-doped carbon as substrate (metal/NC). The essence of activity is related to the extent of the electron transfer capacity (SAs -> NO3-). Among these examined SACs, the Cu/NC presents good performance toward NH3 synthesis, i.e., a maximum NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 100% with a high NH3 yield rate of up to 32,300 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1). X-ray absorption fine structure spectra and density functional theory calculations provide evidence that the electronic structure of Cu-N-4 coordination prohibits the formation of N-2, N2O, and H-2 and facilitates the orbital hybridization between the 2p orbitals of NO3- and 3d orbitals of Cu single-atom sites. Our study is believed to provide fundamental guidance for the future design of highly efficient electrocatalysts in NO3- reduction to NH3.\nDeveloping efficient nanostructured electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 under mild conditions remains a major challenge. The Fe-Mo cofactor serves as the archetypal active site in nitrogenase. Inspired by nitrogenase, we designed a series of heteronuclear dual-atom catalysts (DACs) labeled as FeMoN6-aXa (a=1, 2, 3; X=B, C, O, S) anchored on the pore of g-C3N4 to probe the impact of coordination on FeMo-catalyzed nitrogen fixation. The stability, reaction paths, activity, and selectivity of 12 different FeMoN6-aXa DACs have been systematically studied using density functional theory. Of these, four DACs (FeMoN5B1, FeMoN5O1, FeMoN4O2, and FeMoN3C3) displayed promising nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. Notably, FeMoN5O1 stands out with an ultralow limiting potential of -0.11 V and\n######################\noutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>Co<|>chemical element<|>Co is a
