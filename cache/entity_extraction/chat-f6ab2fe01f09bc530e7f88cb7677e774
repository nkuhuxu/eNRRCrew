This work demonstrates an efficient in situ assembly strategy for bimetallic oxide electrocatalysts, which can improve the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen to ammonia at ambient temperature and pressure.\nIn this study, niobium nitride (NbN) is prepared via the urea-glass route by annealing a mixture of NbCl5 and urea at 650 degrees C under a flow of N2, and is used as a catalyst for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). The as-prepared NbN exhibits a maximum production rate of 5.46 x 10-10 mol s-1 cm-2 at -0.6 V vs. RHE, along with an apparent FE of 16.33% at -0.3 V vs. RHE. In addition, the leaching of NbN is confirmed by ICP-OES, where the leached amount of Nb is almost identical to the amount of N measured by UV-vis. Moreover, 1H NMR experiments are performed using 15N2 as the feeder gas; the dominant detection of 14NH4+ peaks strongly suggests that the produced NH3 originates from the leaching of NbN rather than via an electrocatalytic process. Hence, for a comprehensive understanding of NH3 generation, especially when utilizing transition metal nitride (TMN)-based NRR catalysts, a thorough investigation employing multiple analytical methods is imperative. A NbN catalyst is prepared by the urea-glass route for NRR, with the produced NH3 originating from the leaching of NbN, rather than from an electrochemical reaction.\nElectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) has attracted much attention for yielding ammonia. Thus, it is of great significance to exploit new catalysts with a high nitrate-to-ammonia (NO3--to-NH3) activity. In this study, we embedded different concentrations of Cu in an oxide octahedral molecular sieve (Cu(x)-OMS-1). We found that the Cu-dispersed OMS-1 optimizes the adsorption capabilities of the intermediates in NITRR and inhibits the competitive HER at a high current density. We reveal, using operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical investigations, that the introduction of copper effectively promotes nitrate protonation during NITRR. Consequently, the catalyst presents the capacity for reducing nitrate to ammonia at a high current density (>100 mA cm(-2)) with similar to 100% Faraday efficiency. The maximum NH3 partial current density reaches 148 mA cm(-2) with a high production rate (0.69 mmol h(-1) cm(-2)).\nElectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is a promising method for sustainable ammonia production. Although the majority of studies on the eNRR are devoted to developing efficient electrocatalysts, it is critical to study the influence of mass transfer because of the poor N2 transfer efficiency. Herein, a novel bubble-based microreactor (BBMR) is proposed that efficiently promotes the mass transfer behavior during the eNRR using microfluidic strategies. The BBMR possesses abundant triphasic interfaces and provides spatial confinement and accurate potential control, ensuring rapid mass transfer dynamics and improved eNRR performance, as confirmed by experimental and simulation studies. The ammonia yield of the reaction over Ag nanoparticles can be enhanced to 31.35 mu g h-1 mgcat.-1, which is twice that of the H-cell. Excellent improvements are also achieved using Ru/C and Fe/g-CN catalysts, with 5.0 and 8.5 times increase in ammonia yield, respectively. This work further demonstrates the significant effect of mass transfer on the eNRR performance and provides an effective strategy for process enhancement through electrode design. A novel bubble-based microreactor to efficiently promote mass transfer during the eNRR using microfluidic strategies is presented. Benefiting from abundant triphasic interfaces, spatial confinement, and accurate potential control, the rapid mass transfer dynamics and improved eNRR performance can be efficiently ensured. This work demonstrates the significance of mass transfer and provides an effective strategy for process enhancement through the electrode design.image\nElectrochemical ammonia (NH3) production from dinitrogen (N2) could be an environmentally sustainable alternative to the traditional manufacturing process (Haber-Bosch). However, a flow electrolysis cell that could elevate the ammonia production to a scale of practical relevance has not been demonstrated yet for this emerging technology. Besides N2, NH3 can be electrochemically produced from nitrogen-containing compounds such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrite (NO2-), and nitrate (NO3-). Product crossover in those processes could significantly interfere with accurate performance evaluation, which has received limited attention. Herein, the commonly used Nafion N112 membrane was found ineffective at preventing the undesired crossover of NH3 or ammonium (NH4+) ions in a flow cell even at the 1 ppm concentration level, with a normalized flux as high as 247 mu mol m -2h-1 in Na2SO4 at-0.1 mA cm-2. Severe NH4+ adsorption in Nafion was also observed, particularly when no supporting electrolyte is present. Moreover, the interactions between Nafion and NH4+ depend on the supporting electrolyte type, pH changes induced by ion exchange and applied current during continuous electrolysis. Increasing the membrane thickness altered the rate of NH4+ losses, however, the NH4+ crossover and volatilization cannot be fully mitigated. Lastly, the cation exchange between membrane-adsorbed NH4+ and Na+ from the electrolyte is proposed as a membrane-cleaning procedure to reduce false positives in electrochemical NH3/NH4+ production studies\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
