This strategy provides direct access to analogues with different N-X bonds (X = S, C and so on) and metal cations (Li+, Zn2+ and so on) by extending the substrate scope, and can be scaled up for improved energy efficiency and atom economy. This work provides a general electrosynthesis protocol for the practical production of N-containing chemicals and has potential implications for a wider field of sustainable chemistry.\nThe Haber-Bosch process, commonly used for ammonia synthesis, can be replaced by the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), which offers a more environmentally conscious and sustainable approach. However, developing electrocatalysts with low potential, high selectivity, and fast reaction kinetics remains challenging. In the current work, we have theoretically calculated the potential of V@B5N3 and V@B7N5 (V = Vanadium) material which serves as an electrocatalyst for NRR using density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Our results reveal that the monolayer of V@B7N5 exhibits remarkable catalytic activity and effectively suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction at an overpotential of 0.13 V.
