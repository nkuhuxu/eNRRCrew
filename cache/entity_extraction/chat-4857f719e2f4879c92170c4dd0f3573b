However, the development of high-performance NRR electrocatalysts with satisfactory efficiency and selectivity remains a significant challenge. Herein, we design and synthesize two metal-porphyrin based 3D COFs bearing metal-N4 catalytic sites with different 3D spatial arrangements (scu and flu topologies) for this purpose. The anchoring of metal ions (Fe, Cu) at the center of the planar conjugated-porphyrin ring enhances the activity and selectivity of electrocatalytic NRR. Significantly, the 3D COFs with Fe-N4 catalytic sites feature higher NH3 yield and Faradaic efficiency (94.26 +/- 4.9 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) and 18.37 +/- 0.96 % at-0.5 V vs RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) than those with Cu-N-4 centers, making them promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts. This work not only enriches the topological library of 3D COFs, but also provides an idea for the rational design of metal porphyrin-based COFs for NH3 production.\nDue to the alarming increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, there is an urgent need to replace the fossil fuel-driven Haber-Bosch process with green ammonia production. Electrochemical nitrogen fixation has shown preliminary promise for industrially ammonia synthesis, but an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the nitrogen reduction process remains limited. Herein, a unique dinitrogen desorption mechanism for the nitrogen reduction reaction is detected on the bismuth nanocrystals, which may explain some intriguing phenomena reported in previous works, including (1) why hydrazine is still generated in some nitrogen reduction reactions that do not follow the alternating pathway, and (2) a minor change in bismuth particle size can lead to a dramatic change in NRR performance. In addition, the experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the dinitrogen desorption pathway involving the transfer of two electrons usually shows lower energy barriers and faster reaction kinetics, resulting in a dramatic enhancement in NRR performance.\nThe electrocatalytic conversion of nitric oxide (NORR) to ammonia (NH3) represents a pivotal approach for sustainable energy transformation and efficient waste utilization. Designing highly effective catalysts to facilitate the conversion of NO into NH3 remains a formidable challenge. In this work, the density functional theory (DFT) is used to design NORR catalysts based on single and double transition metal (TM:Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) atoms supported by graphdiyne (TM@GDY). Among eight catalysts, the Cu2@GDY is selected as a the most stable NORR catalyst with high NH3 activity and selectivity. A pivotal discovery underscores that the NORR mechanism is thermodynamically constrained on single atom catalysts (SACs), while being governed by electrochemical processes on double atom catalysts (DACs), a distinction arising from the different d -band centers of these catalysts. Therefore, this work not only introduces an efficient NORR catalyst but also provides crucial insights into the fundamental parameters influencing NORR performance.\nThe exceptional electronic properties and potential applications of black phosphorus (BP) have garnered significant interest in the fields of electrochemical catalysis and energy storage. However, its poor environmental stability severely hampers its practical use. In this study, an innovative strategy is proposed to protect fresh black phosphorene (BPene) against oxidation by adsorbing or weakly bonding aluminum ions (Al3+) onto its surface, while facilitating their self-removal under operating conditions. By leveraging Al3+-protected black phosphorene (Al-BPene) as a catalyst for the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen to ammonia (NH3), the effectiveness of this removable Al3+-protected strategy is demonstrated. Quantitative analysis reveals that Al-BPene maintains structural and compositional stability for over 7 days under ambient conditions, while the Al3+ can be readily eliminated through self-desorption or dissolution in the electrolyte. With highly active sites pre-protected, Al-BPene exhibits a striking NH3 yield rate of 55.1 mu g h-1 mg cat-1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 66.5% in alkaline media, as exemplified by the representative application example. Moreover, it is found that the prepared Al-BPene can tolerate a thermal environment, and a higher NH3 yield rate of 75 mu g h-1 mg cat-1 at 60 degrees C is recorded. Undoubtedly, these findings pave the way for broader applications of BPene. A removable aluminum ion protection strategy is proposed to protect black phosphorene against oxidation under ambient conditions, while facilitating the self-removal of aluminum to regenerate fresh black phosphorene with enhanced reactivity under operating conditions. As exemplified by a representative application, this approach enables black phosphorene to exhibit an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 66.5% for ammonia electrosynthesis.image\nElectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) paves a sustainable way to produce NH3 but suffering from the relatively low NH3 yield and poor selectivity. High-performance NRR catalysts and a deep insight into the structure-performance relationship are higher desired. Herein, a molten-salt approach is developed to synthesize tiny CeO2 nanoparticles anchored by ultra-thin MoN nanosheets as advanced catalysts for NRR. Specifically, a considerably high NH3 yield rate of 27.5 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) with 17.2% Faradaic efficiency (FE) can be achieved at -0.3 V vs (\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
