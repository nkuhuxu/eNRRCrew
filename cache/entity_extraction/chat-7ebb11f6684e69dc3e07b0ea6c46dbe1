Herein, a molten-salt approach is developed to synthesize tiny CeO2 nanoparticles anchored by ultra-thin MoN nanosheets as advanced catalysts for NRR. Specifically, a considerably high NH3 yield rate of 27.5 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) with 17.2% Faradaic efficiency (FE) can be achieved at -0.3 V vs (RHE) under ambient conditions. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further point out that the incorporation of MoN with CeO2 can promotes the enlargement of the electron deficient area of nitrogen vacancy site. The enlarged electron deficient area contributes to the accommodation of lone pair electrons of N-2, which dramatically improves the N-2 adsorption/activation and the key intermediates (*NNH and *NH3) generation, thus boosting the NRR performance.\nThe synthesis of N-containing chemicals directly from N-2 is highly desirable in chemistry but has been challenged by inert N-2 molecules and limited product scope. Herein we propose a cascade electrosynthesis strategy for the facile reduction of N-2 and subsequent conversion to various N-containing chemicals via a looped Li-N-2 battery. The electrosynthesis of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide is illustrated as a prototype using cascade reactions involving electrocatalytic N-2 reduction to Li3N on discharge, a relay reaction of Li3N acylation to lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and finally the elimination of the LiCl by-product on charge to complete the synthesis loop. This strategy provides direct access to analogues with different N-X bonds (X = S, C and so on) and metal cations (Li+, Zn2+ and so on) by extending the substrate scope, and can be scaled up for improved energy efficiency and atom economy. This work provides a general electrosynthesis protocol for the practical production of N-containing chemicals and has potential implications for a wider field of sustainable chemistry.\nThe Haber-Bosch process, commonly used for ammonia synthesis, can be replaced by the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), which offers a more environmentally conscious and sustainable approach. However, developing electrocatalysts with low potential, high selectivity, and fast reaction kinetics remains challenging. In the current work, we have theoretically calculated the potential of V@B5N3 and V@B7N5 (V = Vanadium) material which serves as an electrocatalyst for NRR using density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Our results reveal that the monolayer of V@B7N5 exhibits remarkable catalytic activity and effectively suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction at an overpotential of 0.13 V. Furthermore, the potential-determining step involving the conversion of *N-2-*N2H demonstrates a favourable energy barrier, indicating facile kinetics. The V@B7N5 monolayer shows promising selectivity, with an anticipated ammonia production efficiency of 99%. These findings open avenues for employing single-atom catalysts under ambient conditions to synthesise ammonia, offering a potential solution for sustainable ammonia production.\nElectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising technology for ammonia synthesis under environmental conditions due to its simplicity of operation, high energy conversion, and environmental friendliness. While development of an efficient and stable electrocatalyst is one of the remaining key challenges. In this paper, the electrocatalytic performance of single Ru atoms anchored in Bn-doped graphyne (RuBn@GY) is systematically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results show that RuB@GY is a highly efficient NRR electrocatalyst with a distal and alternating mechanism considered to be the most active catalytic pathway, with a limiting potential of only - 0.53 V. Overall, our study facilitates the NRR reaction by controlling the number and position of the doped B atoms to reduce the limiting potential, and this work provides theoretical guidance for the further development of highly active and stable single-atom catalysts (SACs).Graphical Abstract Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising technology for ammonia synthesis under environmental conditions due to its simplicity of operation, high energy conversion, and environmental friendliness.\nWe compared the production rates and the destruction frequencies of ammonia in inductively coupled H2O/N-2 and H-2/N-2 plasmas. We observed that the production rates of ammonia ranged between 4 and 7 mu mol/s both in the H2O/N-2 and H-2/N-2 plasmas generated at rf powers between 100 and 160 W, corresponding to the energy cost of 23-25 mol/MJ. Almost the same production rates suggest the usefulness of H2O as the resource for hydrogenation of atomic nitrogen adsorbed on surfaces. On the other hand, the destruction frequency was 2-4 times higher in the H2O/N-2 than H-2/N-2 plasmas. Although the H2O/N-2 plasma has a drawback in the destruction frequency, the present work shows its potential for the direct synthesis of ammonia from water with skipping the production of hydrogen.\nDeveloping low-cost and sustainable catalytic systems to realize efficient nitrogen fixation has always been the pursued goal. Here, we report an efficient electrocatalyst synthesized via a simple self-assembly process from supramolecular cucurbit[6]uril (Q[6]) and a heteropolyacid for nitrogen oxidation. The as-prepared self-assembly material Q[6]-PMA with high stability and specific surface area shows a prominent activity in the electrocatalytic nitrogen\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
