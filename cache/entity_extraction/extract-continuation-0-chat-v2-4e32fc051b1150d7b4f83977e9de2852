Herein, inspired by a few recent works, we performed a comprehensive first-principles calculation on eight vanadium (V)-anchored sulfur (S)-doped graphene catalysts (V-SxCNc-x@Gr) to study their NRR catalytic performance. V-S2C@Gr exhibits superior activity with extremely high limiting potential (U-L) of -0.17 V, outstanding thermodynamic/electrochemical stabilities, and good selectivity. Surprisingly, V-S-3@Gr is even better than V-S2C@Gr. On V-S-3@Gr, the NRR is an exothermic process with continuously decreasing Gibbs free energy. The NRR can spontaneously occur on it without an externally applied potential. We also found that doping more S in the coordination environment of V leads to more charges accumulating around V, thus improving the more effective activation of the NN bond and, finally, higher U-L. It is worth trying the V/S combination on other substrates and more excellent NRR catalysts are expected to be found, this work can provide certain reference basis.\nThe sustainable development of novel photo/electrocatalytic CO2/N-2 fixation for chemical synthesis is predicated on reliable, accurate, and rapid detection methods. The directness, specificity, and simultaneity in detecting multiple molecules of the H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR) technique have aroused increasing interest in photo/electrocatalysis. Thus far, two data processing means have been developed for the precise H-1-NMR data processing: peak integral and peak height methods. However, few detailed studies offer a clear steer for choosing data processing methods for the concerned products in photo/electrocatalysis, especially the guidelines under the conditions of baseline distortions induced by water suppression. Herein, the feasible practices are restudied to quantify classical products in photo/electrocatalytic CO2/N-2 fixation. On the basis of experimental results, H-1-NMR data processing methods (peak integral and peak height methods) are found to convey different applicability for the different low-concentration products, while introducing water suppression in the H-1-NMR tests. The essential reason can be attributed to the baseline distortions caused by the water suppression, which arouses differentiated deviation of peaks with different peak widths. With this in mind, an accessible quantification criterion is provided to avoid superfluous input of time or cost in precise H-1-NMR detection of low-concentration products.\nUnderstanding the correlation between the fundamental descriptors and catalytic performance is meaningful to guide the design of high-performance electrochemical catalysts. However, exploring key factors that affect catalytic performance in the vast catalyst space remains challenging for people. Herein, to accurately identify the factors that affect the performance of N-2 reduction, we apply interpretable machine learning (ML) to analyze high-throughput screening results, which is also suited to other surface reactions in catalysis. To expound on the paradigm, 33 promising catalysts are screened from 168 carbon-supported candidates, specifically single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported by a BC3 monolayer (TM@V-B/C-Nn = 0-3-BC3) via high-throughput screening. Subsequently, the hybrid sampling method and XGBoost model are selected to classify eligible and non-eligible catalysts. Through feature interpretation using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis, two crucial features, that is, the number of valence electrons (N-v) and nitrogen substitution (N-n), are screened out. Combining SHAP analysis and electronic structure calculations, the synergistic effect between an active center with low valence electron numbers and reasonable C-N coordination (a medium fraction of nitrogen substitution) can exhibit high catalytic performance. Finally, six superior catalysts with a limiting potential lower than -0.4 V are predicted. Our workflow offers a rational approach to obtaining key information on catalytic performance from high-throughput screening results to design efficient catalysts that can be applied to other materials and reactions.\nCu-based catalysts possess great potential in the electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3-) reduction reaction for ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the low atomic economy limits their further application. Here we report a Cu single-atom (SA) incorporated in nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu SA/NC) with high atomic economy, which exhibits superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 100% along with an impressive NH3 yield rate of 7480 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1). As counterparts, Cus+n/NC, with mixed SA and nanoparticles (NPs), shows decreasing NH3 FE with decreasing SA content, but the production of N-2 and N2O increases gradually, which reaches the maximum on pure Cu NPs. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that a higher NH3 FE of Cu SA/NC is ascribed to a lower free energy of the rate-limiting step (HNO* -> N*) and effective inhibition for the N-N coupled process. This work provides the intuitive activity trends of Cu-based catalysts, opening an avenue for subsequent catalysts design.\nElectrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) is regarded as a viable alternative reaction to Haber Bosch process. Nevertheless, it remains a major challenge to explore economical and efficient electrocatalysts that deliver high NH3 yield rates and Faraday efficiencies (FE). Here, it demonstrates the fabrication of a 3D core-shell structured Co-carbon nanofibers (CNF)/ZIF-CoP for NO3RR application.
