Here, we report an efficient electrocatalyst synthesized via a simple self-assembly process from supramolecular cucurbit[6]uril (Q[6]) and a heteropolyacid for nitrogen oxidation. The as-prepared self-assembly material Q[6]-PMA with high stability and specific surface area shows a prominent activity in the electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR), affording a yield of nitrate (NO3-) of up to 271.5 +/- 5.6 mu g h-1 mgcat-1 with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 71.2 +/- 3.8%. The 15N isotope-labeling experiment confirmed that the nitrogen source of nitrate formation is derived from N2. The results of the in situ XPS technique and in situ FITR experiments demonstrate that the molybdenum center of Q[6]-PMA is the main active site of the NOR and the corresponding cucurbit[6]uril unit is conducive to the stability of key intermediates. A supramolecular self-assembler of cucurbit[6]uril-phosphomolybdic acid with a multi-valence state is constructed to realize an efficient nitrogen oxidation reaction.\nThe catalytic mechanisms of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on the pristine and Co/alpha-MoC(001) surfaces were explored by density functional theory calculations. The results show that the preferred pathway is that a direct N equivalent to N cleavage occurs first, followed by continuous hydrogenations. The production of second NH3 molecule is identified as the rate-limiting step on both systems with kinetic barriers of 1.5 and 2.0 eV, respectively, indicating that N-2-to-NH3 transformation on bimetallic surface is more likely to occur. The two components of the bimetallic center play different roles during NRR process, in which Co atom does not directly participate in the binding of intermediates, but primarily serves as a reservoir of H atoms. This special synergy makes Co/alpha-MoC(001) have superior activity for ammonia synthesis. The introduction of Co not only facilitates N-2 dissociation, but also accelerates the migration of H atom due to the antibonding characteristic of Co-H bond. This study offers a facile strategy for the rational design and development of efficient catalysts for ammonia synthesis and other reactions involving the hydrogenation processes.\nThe synthesis of ammonia via electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) provides an attractive alternative approach to the traditional Haber-Bosch process. In this regard, a one-step hydrothermal method was adopted to synthesize a bimetallic oxide, ferric molybdate (Fe2(MoO4)3), coated with carbon black on the surface (denoted as Fe2(MoO4)3/C). The carbon black coating minimizes aggregation of Fe2(MoO4)3, leading to increased electrochemical active sites for NRR. Additionally, this coating improves the electrical conductivity of Fe2(MoO4)3 thereby accelerating electron transfer between carbon black and Fe2(MoO4)3, which is beneficial to charge transfer and enlarge the electrochemical active surface areas. At a potential of -0.4 VRHE (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), the ammonia yield achieved was up to 51.76 mg h-1 mgcat-1, with a Faradaic efficiency of 90.63% at -0.35VRHE. Impressively, this electrocatalyst exhibited excellent cycle stability and durability.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, the research on NORR electrocatalysts mainly focuses on metal-based catalysts, while metal-free catalysts are quite scarce. In this work, we have systematically investigated the properties of pristine and C/O doped h-BN for efficient NO capture and reduction. Our results reveal that the basal plane of pristine h-BN is inert to the adsorption of NO, while doping C or O can significantly enhance the NO capture abilities of h-BN. Then, we highlight that C-doped h-BN exhibits excellent NORR catalytic performance with a relatively low limiting potential of -0.28 V. Further analysis shows that the suitable adsorption strength of NO on the C-doped h-BN surface is the prime reason for its excellent NO reduction activity, which is shown to be due to appropriate electronic interactions between the active site and NO. Last but not least, the catalytic selectivity of h-BN towards the NORR is confirmed by inhibiting the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Our findings not only provide deeper insight into the essential effect of element doping on the catalytic activities of h-BN, but also propose general design principles for high-performance metal-free NORR electrocatalysts. The electrochemical NO reduction reaction (NORR) towards NH3 is considered a promising strategy to cope with both NO removal and NH3 production.\nElectrocatalyst plays animportant role in electrochemical ammonia synthesis by determining the nitrogen reduction reaction pathway. Featuring the inherent half-filled 3d orbitals, ion-based alloy electrocatalysts have been attracting much more attention owing to the controllable driving force to adsorb and activate N equivalent to N bonds. Besides supplying unoccupied d-orbital to accommodate lone-pair electrons to facilitate nitrogen adsorption, donating d-orbital electrons to nitrogen antibonding orbitals to dissociate N equivalent to N bond is demandedas well.
