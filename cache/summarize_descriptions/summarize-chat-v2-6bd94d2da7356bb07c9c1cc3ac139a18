{"result": "g-C3N4 is a versatile material utilized in the field of electrochemistry, particularly for its role in enhancing nitrogen fixation activity. It serves as a substrate for immobilizing the Fe-Mo center within dual-atom catalysts (DACs), which are designed to optimize the nitrogen reduction reaction. By anchoring these heteronuclear DACs, g-C3N4 facilitates improved catalytic performance, thereby contributing to increased ammonia (NH3) yield and faradaic efficiency in electrochemical processes. Its structural characteristics and ability to stabilize active sites make g-C3N4 a crucial component in the development of advanced catalysts for nitrogen fixation.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in electrochemistry and catalysis.
