{"result": "The Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) is a significant electrochemical process that competes with nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR). HER plays a crucial role in influencing the conversion yield and Faradaic efficiency of NRR, as it can divert electrons and protons away from the desired nitrogen reduction pathway. Understanding the dynamics of HER is essential for optimizing NRR, as effective management of HER can enhance the overall performance of catalysts used in these reactions.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in electrochemistry and catalysis.
