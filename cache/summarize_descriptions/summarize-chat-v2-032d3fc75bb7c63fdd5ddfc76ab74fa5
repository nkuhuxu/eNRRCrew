{"result": "The entity \"100%\" refers to the Faradaic efficiency (FE) achieved by various copper-based electrocatalysts in the synthesis of ammonia (NH3) and during nitrate reduction to ammonia. Specifically, the Cu SA/NC electrocatalyst, the Cu-dispersed OMS-1, and the modified Cu/Cu2O electrocatalyst all achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 100% for ammonia synthesis, with the latter occurring at a potential of -0.6 V vs RHE. Additionally, the Cu/NC electrocatalyst also reached a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 100% for NH3 synthesis. This indicates that these copper-based catalysts are highly effective in facilitating the electrochemical conversion processes related to ammonia production.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in electrochemistry and catalysis.
