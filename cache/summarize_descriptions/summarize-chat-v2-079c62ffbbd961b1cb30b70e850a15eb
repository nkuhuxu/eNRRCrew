{"result": "FeMoN5B1 is identified as one of the four dual-atom catalysts (DACs) that exhibited promising performance in nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR). This catalyst is characterized as a heteronuclear dual-atom catalyst, which suggests that it consists of different metal atoms that work synergistically to enhance the efficiency of the NRR process. The performance of FeMoN5B1 in catalyzing the conversion of nitrogen to ammonia indicates its potential for applications in sustainable ammonia synthesis, a critical process in agricultural and industrial sectors.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in electrochemistry and catalysis.
