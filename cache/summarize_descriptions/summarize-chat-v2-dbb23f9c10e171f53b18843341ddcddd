{"result": "The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) is a promising method for ammonia production that seeks to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact. This process is significantly influenced by the presence of vanadium-nitrogen (V-N) in transition metal@boron carbon nitride (TM@BC3N2) systems, which can affect the performance of the reaction. Overall, eNRR represents a vital area of research aimed at developing sustainable approaches to ammonia synthesis.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in electrochemistry and catalysis.
