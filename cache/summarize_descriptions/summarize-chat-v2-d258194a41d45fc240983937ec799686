{"result": "Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are a specialized class of electrocatalysts that have been extensively studied for their efficacy in nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR). These catalysts are particularly notable for their role in synthesizing ammonia through the reduction of nitrate. The unique structural characteristics of SACs, which involve isolated metal atoms dispersed on a support, contribute to their enhanced performance in these electrochemical processes. Researchers are actively exploring the optimization of SACs to improve ammonia yield and faradaic efficiency, making them a focal point in the advancement of sustainable ammonia production technologies.", "input": "\nYou are an expert in electrochemistry and catalysis.
